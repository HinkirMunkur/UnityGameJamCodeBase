## FSM (Finite State Machine) System

This system can be used in any setting which has finite number of states and any number of transitions among that states. For example: If we have a character which has idle, run and crouch states, we need to create idle, run and crouch states. Afterwards, add transitions from idle to run and crouch. However, there won't be any transition from run to crouch.


## Transition System

The aim is to record various scene transitions and enable their utilization in a desired manner on your projeckts.


## Camera System

This system allows you to create different camera systems which each system have any number of virtual cameras also allowed transition between cameras in-system any time.


## Input System

This system consists of two different classes where one for touch and the other for mouse click. Both have three actions for an input where first object can be touched/clicked, second dragging/moving and the third is released.


## Executable System // task ve priority system


## Button Activity

This system allows you to assign to keys specific functions or tasks.


## Database

This system allows you to store your data in JSON format which allowes you to create your own structures.


## Animation System

This system ease you to create animations and transitions between them without the overhead of using Unity's Animator.
